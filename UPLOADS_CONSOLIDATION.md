# Uploads Directory Consolidation

## Summary
Consolidated file upload handling to use only `backend/uploads/` directory instead of having two separate uploads directories.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Before (Problematic)
- Two uploads directories existed:
  - `web_dev/uploads/` (root level)
  - `web_dev/backend/uploads/` (backend level)
- Backend was using conditional logic to check both directories
- Inconsistent file storage location depending on how backend was started

### ✅ After (Fixed)
- **Single uploads directory**: `web_dev/backend/uploads/`
- **Consistent file storage**: All uploaded files and processing results go to `backend/uploads/`
- **Simplified logic**: No more conditional directory checks

## Files Updated

### 1. `backend/app_workflow.py`
```python
# Old (problematic):
UPLOADS_DIR = Path('../uploads') if Path('../uploads').exists() else Path('uploads')

# New (fixed):
UPLOADS_DIR = Path('uploads')  # Always uses backend/uploads/ when run from backend/
```

### 2. `.gitignore`
- Removed reference to root-level `uploads/`
- Kept `backend/uploads/` in ignore list (contains user data)

### 3. Directory Structure
- **Removed**: `web_dev/uploads/` (redundant root directory)
- **Kept**: `web_dev/backend/uploads/` (primary uploads directory)

## Directory Structure Now
```
web_dev/
├── backend/
│   ├── uploads/           # ✅ All uploaded files go here
│   ├── preprocessed_unencoded/  # ✅ All processed files go here
│   └── app_workflow.py    # ✅ Uses backend/uploads/
├── frontend/
├── model/
└── ...
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All uploads always go to the same location
2. **Simplicity**: No more conditional directory logic
3. **Organization**: User data stays within the backend module
4. **Git**: Cleaner ignore patterns, no confusion about which uploads directory to ignore

## Testing
- ✅ Backend starts correctly with new directory structure
- ✅ Uploads directory is correctly identified as `backend/uploads/`
- ✅ Data retention manager uses the correct directory
- ✅ File upload and processing will use consistent location
